:wave:

This is the source code for my [personal site][1] using [Jekyll][2]. I've structured the project so that it can be [forked](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and updated through files in the `_data` directory.
Here are a few things I need to-do before v1 launch:
- [x] update readme
- [ ] keep it simple with HTML, CSS, and JS
- [ ] share on social
- [x] make it public
