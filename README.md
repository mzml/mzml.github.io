# mzml.io

:wave: This is the source code for my [personal site][1] using [Jekyll][2] and hosted by [GitHubPages][3]. I've structured the project so that it can be [forked](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and updated through data files to suite it for your needs.
Here are a few things I need to-do before v1 launch:
- [ ]  [update readme][4]
- [ ]  keep it simple with HTML, CSS, and JS
- [ ]  share on social
