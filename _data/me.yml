sayit: (mo-ZA-mil)

background: |
    I am a seeker at heart wanting to learn more about the technology that is changing our lives.
    In software development I've found an opportunity to narrow in on a love in life.
    A journey of a thousand lines of code should begin with a failing test.


greeting:
    - Salaam!
